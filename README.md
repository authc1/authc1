### Example Usage

```javascript
import { Authc1Client } from '@authc1/auth-js';

const client = new Authc1Client('your-app-id-here');

async function signIn() {
  try {
    const result = await client.signInWithEmail('user@example.com', 'password123');
    console.log('Signed in successfully!');
    console.log('Access token:', result.access_token);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error signing in:', error);
  }

    console.log('User registered successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error registering user:', error);
